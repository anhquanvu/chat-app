# Real-Time Chat Application

A comprehensive enterprise-grade chat application built with Spring Boot and modern web technologies, featuring real-time messaging, advanced user management, and scalable architecture designed for production environments.

## Overview

This chat application provides a complete messaging platform supporting both direct conversations and group rooms. The system incorporates real-time WebSocket communication, robust authentication mechanisms, message reaction capabilities, and advanced features commonly found in modern messaging platforms like Discord, Slack, and Telegram.

## Core Features

### Authentication & User Management
The application implements JWT-based authentication with refresh token support, providing secure user registration and login functionality. Users can manage their profiles, including avatar uploads, bio information, and online status tracking. The system maintains comprehensive user sessions across multiple devices and provides real-time online/offline status updates.

### Real-Time Messaging
Built on WebSocket technology, the application delivers instant message delivery with typing indicators and message status tracking. The messaging system supports rich text content, file attachments, and handles both one-on-one conversations and multi-participant room discussions. Message delivery status includes sent, delivered, and read confirmations with appropriate visual indicators.

### Room & Conversation Management
Users can create and participate in group rooms with configurable settings including room descriptions, member management, and administrative controls. Direct conversations enable private messaging between users with end-to-end conversation history. The system provides comprehensive participant management with role-based permissions for room administration.

### Message Reactions & Interactions
The platform supports message reactions with emoji responses, allowing users to provide quick feedback without additional messages. Users can add multiple reaction types to messages, view reaction statistics, and see who reacted with each emoji type. The reaction system updates in real-time across all connected clients.

### Message Threading & Replies
Advanced message threading capabilities allow users to reply to specific messages, creating organized conversation flows. Reply functionality includes visual indicators showing the original message context, sender information, and content preview. The threading system maintains conversation structure while supporting nested reply chains.

### Message Pinning & Organization
Important messages can be pinned within rooms or conversations for easy reference. Pinned messages display in a dedicated section with options to navigate directly to the original message location. The system tracks who pinned each message and provides appropriate permissions for pin management.

### Search & Discovery
Comprehensive search functionality enables users to find messages across all conversations and rooms using keyword queries. Advanced search filters include date ranges, sender information, and content type filtering. Search results display with context and direct navigation to original message locations.

### File Sharing & Attachments
Robust file upload system supports multiple file types including images, documents, and media files. The application provides file type validation, size restrictions, and secure storage mechanisms. Uploaded files display with appropriate previews and download capabilities while maintaining access control.

### User Contact Management
Built-in contact system allows users to manage friend lists, send contact requests, and organize their network of communication partners. Contact management includes approval workflows, blocking capabilities, and contact organization features.

### Administrative Features
Comprehensive administrative controls provide user management, room moderation, and system monitoring capabilities. Administrative functions include user account management, content moderation tools, and system usage analytics.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure
The application utilizes Spring Boot 3.5.0 with Java 17, providing a robust and scalable foundation. The architecture incorporates Spring Security for authentication, Spring Data JPA for database operations, and Spring WebSocket for real-time communication. The system design follows enterprise patterns with comprehensive error handling and transaction management.

### Database Design
MySQL database implementation with HikariCP connection pooling ensures optimal performance and scalability. The database schema supports complex relationships between users, messages, rooms, and associated metadata. Proper indexing strategies optimize query performance for message retrieval and search operations.

### Real-Time Communication
WebSocket implementation provides instant message delivery with automatic reconnection handling and session management. The system maintains active user tracking, typing indicators, and message status synchronization across all connected clients. WebSocket security integration ensures authenticated communication channels.

### Caching & Performance
Strategic caching implementation improves response times for frequently accessed data including user sessions, message metadata, and room information. The application supports both in-memory and Redis-based caching solutions for different deployment scenarios.

### Security Implementation
Comprehensive security measures include JWT token authentication, CORS configuration, rate limiting, and input validation. The system implements proper authorization checks for all operations and maintains audit trails for security monitoring.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure Java 17 or higher is installed along with Maven 3.6 or higher for dependency management. MySQL 8.0 or higher is required for optimal database compatibility and performance.

### Database Configuration
Create a MySQL database named `chatapp` and configure the connection details in `application.yml`. The application will automatically create the required tables on first startup using Hibernate DDL generation.

### Application Configuration
Update the `application.yml` file with your specific environment settings including database credentials, JWT secret keys, and CORS origins. Configure file upload directories and size limits according to your deployment requirements.

### Build & Deployment
Execute `mvn clean install` to build the application, then run using `java -jar target/chatapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` or through your preferred deployment method. The application will start on port 8080 by default.

## API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is available through Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html` when the application is running. The documentation includes detailed endpoint descriptions, request/response schemas, and interactive testing capabilities for all available operations.

## Production Considerations

### Performance Optimization
The application includes production-ready configurations for connection pooling, caching strategies, and database optimization. Monitor system resources and adjust pool sizes based on concurrent user loads and message volume requirements.

### Security Hardening
Implement proper firewall configurations, regular security updates, and monitoring systems for production deployments. Configure appropriate rate limiting values and review authentication settings for your security requirements.

### Scalability Planning
The architecture supports horizontal scaling through load balancer deployment and database clustering. Consider implementing Redis for session management and caching in multi-instance deployments.

### Monitoring & Maintenance
Utilize Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for health monitoring and performance metrics. Implement proper logging aggregation and alerting systems for production monitoring requirements.
